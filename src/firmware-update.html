    <h1>Firmware update</h1>
    <p>A firmware upgrade is not required for the Home Assistant SkyConnect at this point. There are no known bugs with the firmware it ships with.</p>
    <p>We're working on making firmware updates available via Home Assistant. You will receive updates automatically in the future.

  <p>
    If you want to have the latest update now: you can use the web-flasher below to install the latest firmware version for Home Assistant SkyConnect directly from your browser over USB. You can also use the web-flasher to flash the Zigbee firmware again if you've previously used the experimental multi-protocol support.
