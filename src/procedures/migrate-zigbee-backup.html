    <p class="text-center note">If you have a Zigbee2MQTT network running, no longer have the stick and want to migrate to Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1.</p>
    <p class="text-center note">Note: this procedure helps migrating the network. This means you won't have to pair all your devices again with Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1. However, some of the higher-level settings cannot be migrated. Elements such as device names may be lost. There is currently no migration path to migrate all the settings.</p>
