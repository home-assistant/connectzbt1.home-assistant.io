    <h1>Currently available firmware for Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1</h1>
    
    <p>
        <span>
            There are currently 2 different recommended firmware options available for Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Zigbee firmware</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the firmware that runs a Zigbee network. It is preinstalled on Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1.</li>
                        <li>Bundled in the <b>Silicon Labs Flasher</b> add-on. In case you have installed one of the other two options at some point, this add-on allows you to re-install the Zigbee firmware. Note that the add-on is only used to flash the firmware. It is never used during operation: ZHA communicates with the Zigbee firmware directly.</li>
                        <li>Other terms you may have seen to designate this firmware: EmberZNet firmware, <abbr title="EmberZnet serial protocol">EZSP</abbr> firmware, Zigbee EZSP</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Thread firmware</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This firmware allows to use Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 as a dedicated Thread border router when used with the <b>Open Thread Border Router</b> addon.</li>
                        <li>Bundled in the <b>Open Thread Border Router</b> add-on.</li>
                        <li>Other terms you may have seen to designate this firmware: OpenThread RCP, RCP OT</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
