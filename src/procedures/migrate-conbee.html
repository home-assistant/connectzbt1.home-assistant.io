<div class="container">
    <p class="text-center note">Follow this guide if you have a deCONZ network running with a ConBee II or RaspBee II and want to migrate to Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 and ZHA.</p>
    <p class="text-center note">Note: this procedure only helps migrate basic network settings to your Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1, customizations like device names will be lost and automations will need to be updated. Most powered devices like lightbulbs will be re-discovered over time (you can speed this up by rebooting the device) but your battery-powered devices may need to be re-joined to the network for the migration to complete. There is currently no migration path to migrate all settings and devices.</p>
