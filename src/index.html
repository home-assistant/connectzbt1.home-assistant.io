    The Home Assistant SkyConnect is the easiest way to add Zigbee support to
    your Home Assistant instance and make it Matter-ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    A future firmware update will bring Thread support; allowing SkyConnect to
    power your Matter and Zigbee networks at the same time.
  </p>
  <h2>Adding it to Home Assistant</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Plug the Home Assistant SkyConnect into the USB extension cable.</li>
    <li>
      Plug the extension cable into your Home Assistant instance. It is
      important to use the USB extension cable. USB 3.0 ports can cause
      interference with 2.4 GHz protocols, including the ones the Home Assistant
      SkyConnect provides.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open Home Assistant. Navigate to configuration -> devices & services and
      set up the discovered Home Assistant SkyConnect.
      <br /><br />
      If you already use Zigbee (ZHA) in Home Assistant with another stick, you
      can migrate to the Home Assistant SkyConnect by clicking the "Migrate
      Radio" button on the
      <a

        >the Zigbee panel</a
      >.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Home Assistant Container</h2>
  <p>
    If you are running Home Assistant in a container, you will need to pass the
    USB device through to the container. See
    <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#exposing-devices"
      >the Docker documentation</a
    >
    for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have set up the pass-through, configure Zigbee in Home Assistant
    and point it at the path of the device.
  </p>
  <h2>Zigbee & Thread</h2>
  <p>
    The Home Assistant SkyConnect is capable of running both Zigbee and Thread
    networks at the same time. This is an experimental feature that we are
    developing. It will be released for Home Assistant Operating System first.
