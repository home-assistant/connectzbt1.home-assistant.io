    <h1>Zigbee and Thread USB stick by the creators of Home Assistant</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect">Home Assistant SkyConnect</a> is the easiest way to add Zigbee to your
      Home Assistant instance. SkyConnect is also an open-source-friendly path to add a Thread border router. Some Matter devices require a Thread network.
