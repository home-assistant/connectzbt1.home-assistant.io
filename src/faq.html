faqs:
  - title: >
      Can I run 2 sticks with ZHA simultaneously?
    content: >
      <p>No. ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation) is single instance only. ZHA cannot control 2 radios at once.</p>
  - title: >
      Can I run 2 sticks with different Zigbee solutions simultaneously?
    content: >
      <p>
        Yes. For example, you can run a stick with deCONZ or Zigbee2MQTT alongside SkyConnect with ZHA.
      </p>
  - title: >
      Can I migrate from a deCONZ or Zigbee2MQTT stick to SkyConnect and keep using the old stick?
    content: >
      <p>No, you can't continue to use both. During migration, the IEEE address of the SkyConnect is replaced by the IEEE address of the old stick. This means that your old stick and your new stick will have the same IEEE address. This is required for the migration process to complete successfully. From this point on-wards you should not operate the old stick in the same area. If you do not migrate the IEEE address from your old stick, you'll have to re-pair many of your devices in order to keep them working.</p>
  - title: >
      Is Zigbee2MQTT supported by SkyConnect?
    content: >
      <p>
        The Home Assistant team officially supports ZHA (Zigbee Home
        Automation), the Zigbee stack integrated into Home Assistant Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Zigbee2MQTT project has <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/#experimental">
        experimental support</a> (in beta stage) for the Silicon Labs radio on
        Home Assistant SkyConnect. With this setting, Zigbee2MQTT is known to work
        on Home Assistant SkyConnect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: The Zigbee Home Automation integration is active by default! If
        you are using Zigbee2MQTT, remember to delete and ignore the discovered
        Zigbee Home Automation integration to avoid interference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: When setting up Zigbee2MQTT with the Home Assistant SkyConnect, you will
        need to configure the adapter type in Zigbee2MQTT. Make sure the following
        is present in your Zigbee2MQTT configuration:
        <pre>
          <code>serial:
            adapter: ezsp
            port: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Nabu_Casa_SkyConnect_v1.0_<usb-serial-number>-if00-port0
            baudrate: 115200
            rtscts: true
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>You can find the port information under <a class="my" href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hardware/" target="_blank">Settings>System>Hardware</a>, then on the menu button, select <b>All Hardware</b> and search for SkyConnect.</p>

      I'm trying to update the SkyConnect firmware using Ubuntu and Chromium. I get a message that the connection failed. What can I do?
    content: >
      <p>You can try the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure hot plug support is enabled.</br>
            <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/chromium-cant-open-serial-port-on-ubuntu-22-04/31139/6">
              as described here</a></li>
          <li>Make sure your user is added to dialout group: <code>sudo adduser [username] dialout</code></li>
          <li>Reboot your system.</li>
          <li>Try again.</li>
        </ol> </p>

      My SkyConnect can't pair or can't communicate with Zigbee devices. What can I do?
    content: >
      <p>SkyConnect can't communicate reliably if it is too close to other electronics which cause interference. Especially USB&nbsp;3.0 devices are known to interfere with the 2.4&nbsp;GHz based protocols such as Zigbee or Thread. The video below  demonstrates this effect: when the stick is moved closely to a source of interference, the light switch and the light cannot communicate.</p>      
      <video width="960" height="540" controls>
          <source src="/images/skyconnect-interference-03.webm" type="video/webm">
      </video>
      <p><b>On a more technical note</b>: SkyConnect's IEEE&nbsp;802.15.4 radio (like any Zigbee radio) uses a technique called CCA (Clear Channel Assessment). It essentially listens on the channel it wants to send before sending. If there is traffic on the channel, it prevents the sender from even becoming active. Traffic is not limited to the Zigbee protocol, also other traffic which uses the same 2.4&nbsp;GHz band or just electromagnetic interference from other devices.
