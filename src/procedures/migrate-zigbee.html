guideName: Migrate a Zigbee2MQTT network

---
<p class="text-center note">If you have a Zigbee2MQTT network running with another stick but want to migrate to SkyConnect.</p>
<p class="text-center note">Note: this procedure helps migrating the network. This means you won't have to pair all your devices again with Home Assistant SkyConnect. However, some of the higher-level settings cannot be migrated. Elements such as device names may be lost. There is currently no migration path to migrate all the settings.</p>
