    <h1>Firmware update</h1>
    <p>A firmware upgrade is not required for the Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 at this point. There are no known bugs with the firmware it ships with.</p>
    <p>We're working on making firmware updates available via Home Assistant. You will receive updates automatically in the future.

  <p>
    This page is for troubleshooting. If you use Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 in Home Assistant, the Home Assistant discovery flow will automatically install the correct firmware. You do not need to install firmware using this tool. Furthermore, on every start of the OpenThread Border router, the latest Thread firmware which is bundled with the add-on will be installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    If for some reason you like to flash a firmware still: you can use the web-flasher below to install the latest firmware version for Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 directly from your browser over USB.
  </p>
  <p>
    The firmware is the same for both <a href="/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-home-assistant-skyconnect-and-connect-zbt-1" target="_blank">Home Assistant SkyConnect</a> and Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1. You can still use the button below for both models.
