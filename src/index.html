    <p>
      Home Assistant SkyConnect is the easiest way to add Zigbee support to your
      Home Assistant instance and make it Matter-ready. Home Assistant SkyConnect features a transmit
      power of up to 20 dBm and over-the-air updates.

    <h3>Zigbee</h3>
    <p>The Home Assistant team officially supports ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation), the Zigbee stack integrated into Home Assistant Core. The following guides describe how to use SkyConnect with ZHA.</p>

      <h3>Thread and Matter</h3>
      <p>SkyConnect comes with experimental support to power Thread (used for some Matter devices) and
        Zigbee networks at the same time. Before [enabling multiprotocol support](/procedures/enable-multiprotocol/), check the section about [multiprotocol issues](about-multiprotocol).</p>
