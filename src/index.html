    <h1>Zigbee and Thread USB stick by the creators of Home Assistant</h1>
    <p>
      Home Assistant SkyConnect is the easiest way to add Zigbee support to your
      Home Assistant instance and make it Matter-ready. It features a transmit
      power of up to 20 dBm and over-the-air updates. A future firmware update
      will bring Thread support; allowing SkyConnect to power your Matter and
      Zigbee networks at the same time.
