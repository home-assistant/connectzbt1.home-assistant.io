    <h1>Zigbee and Thread USB stick by the creators of Home Assistant</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect">Home Assistant SkyConnect</a> is the easiest way to add Zigbee to your
      Home Assistant instance. SkyConnect is also an open-source-friendly path to add a Thread network. Some Matter devices require a Thread network. The Home Assistant developers provide regular firmware updates for SkyConnect to make sure the device stays compatible with Home Assistant.
    </p>
    <h3>Zigbee</h3>
    <p>The SkyConnect comes with a Zigbee firmware pre-installed. Home Assistant officially supports ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation), the Zigbee stack integrated into Home Assistant Core. The following guides describe how to use SkyConnect with ZHA.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/thread/#list-of-thread-border-router-devices">Home Assistant SkyConnect</a> can also be used to power a Thread border router. Currently, enabling Thread involves manual steps. The integration of the Home Assistant Thread border router with Matter is work-in-progress.
